The cuckoo package provides an interface to several Cuckoo solvers:
* [John Tromp's](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo) lean cuckoo solver
* [John Tromp's](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo) mean gpu cuckoo solver
* [Qitmeer's](https://github.com/Qitmeer/qitmeer-lib) cuckaroo solver

The default solver is Qitmeer's cuckaroo, since it doesn't require any additional tooling to use.

The build requirements and usage of the lean/mean+gpu cuckoo solvers is noted in the [External Cuckoo Solver](../../docs/external_cuckoo_solver.md) document.
